Bringing a new pet home is an exciting time, but it's crucial to remember the **"3-3-3 Rule"** for rescue animals. This guideline helps you set realistic expectations for their adjustment period.

### The 3-3-3 Rule:
- **First 3 Days:** Your new pet will likely feel overwhelmed and scared.
    - They are not yet comfortable enough to be themselves. Don't be surprised if they hide or don't eat much.
- **First 3 Weeks:** Your pet is starting to settle in and learn your routine.
    - Their personality will begin to emerge as they realize they are in a safe and stable environment.
- **First 3 Months:** Your pet now feels at home and has built trust with your family.
    - This is when you'll see their true personality, and a real bond has been established.

***
*Patience during this time is the key to building a strong, lifelong foundation of trust.* """)
